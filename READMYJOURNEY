My initial story of starting my job:
When I came to know about the startup from character xyz
For an opportunity to learn the requirements of the industry. I was given my name for
DSA and API Development.Then there was a meeting for details and tasks about them (character xyz).
But, unfortunately, I was not lined up to attend the meeting, I thought at the time
For some reason they didn't select me, this happened from Friday(
10.03.23) and Monday (13.03.23) evening when I was in the lab.
I teased my friends, they were also working for that mission, but I wasn't.
When I cross-checked some volunteers, it was noticed that the cause was not selected
Not enough spaces to fill. Also I joined DSA and API development
I started my work that day (Monday (evening)) with society and enthusiasm.
After my blood dripping tasks, I finished my work before the deadline on Thursday (Friday).
This is how I started and ended my career journey.
